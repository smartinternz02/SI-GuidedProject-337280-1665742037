levels in the modern lifestyle, and there are numerous methods or  resources for learning yoga. 
Yoga can be practiced in yoga centers, through personal tutors, and can also be learned on oneâ€Ÿs  ownwith the help of the Internet, books, recorded clips, etc
In fast-paced lifestyles, many people prefer self  learning because the above  mentioned  resources might  not be  available all the time.
